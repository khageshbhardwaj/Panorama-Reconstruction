# Panorama-Reconstruction

The project included constructing a panoramic image by seamlessly stitching RGB camera images captured over time using the 
optimized quaternions. Leveraging the optimized orientation trajectories obtained through the Gradient Descent algorithm, 
the images were accurately aligned and merged to create a comprehensive panoramic view. This process involved sophisticated
image processing techniques and geometric transformations to ensure smooth and coherent blending of individual frames, 
resulting in a high-quality panoramic representation of the captured scene.

# How to run the code?
This code requires camera data and vicon ground truth data as an input. For this project, this data was provied by the 
instructor. Along with data, provie approprite path to load the data. As a result, code generates an panaromic image by 
stitching RGB camera images over time.
